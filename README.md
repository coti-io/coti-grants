# COTI Builders Program Wishlist

The [COTI Builders Program](https://cotinetwork.notion.site/Overview-COTI-Builders-Program-f742a22ff8ef4e648935362b9b4a9c34) supports the growth of the COTI V2 network and its ecosystem.

This project serves as an initial repository for RFPs we have identified as feasible and/or necessary for the ecosystem.

## What is an RFP?
An RFP (Request for Proposal) is a declaration of interest for others to submit a grant application regarding a specific project. They generally involve issues that the author has identified as useful and/or missing in our ecosystem.

If there is an open RFP here that matches your skillset, feel free to [submit a grant application](https://share.hsforms.com/1Boe4wRQtShet_lfl2Z-nLArddfz).
